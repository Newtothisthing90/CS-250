# CS-250
This repository contains my Sprint Review and Retrospective, summarizing the Agile and Scrum practices I applied throughout the course. It reflects on user stories, team collaboration, and iterative development.

I interpret user needs by breaking them into user stories, which help clarify requirements and prioritize tasks. This approach ensures the program aligns with actual user expectations rather than assumptions.

My development process has shifted toward an Agile mindset, focusing on flexibility and continuous feedback. I plan to incorporate iterative releases and clear communication into future projects to improve efficiency and adaptability.

Being a good team member in software development means contributing to shared goals, maintaining transparency, and communicating effectively. Collaboration and adaptability are key to ensuring project success.
